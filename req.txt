Hello , i have an BEP20 contract on solidity and there is an bug when 
I deploy the contract to testnet there is anything work good expect 
when I add liquidity in pancakeswap i can not buy token there is some error
but with owner account I can buy or if I disable all fees its work

sell/transfer
work good with fee

but buy with any fee is not work

transfer or exchange work for owner coz fee is 0
but when we add fee someone else can not exchange bnb to our token
we got this
The transaction cannot succeed due to error: undefined. 
This is probably an issue with one of the tokens you are swapping.


i changed also the sllipage
but not work
when fee 0 work
when you deploy please off anti whale and enable trading to work
i mean when token minted in functions you see in remix
